So to use this all you have to do is type into the terminal

find(insert the tool you are looking for)

there are tools 1-15 but if you say someother number thats fine
and then it will print which box the tool that you are looking for is in

I'm not gonna lie if you steal this i'd be honored so there is no copyright on this bad boi
Oh yea its python 3.7
Not positive pretty sure though
